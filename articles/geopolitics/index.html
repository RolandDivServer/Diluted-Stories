      <p>Climate change is no longer just an environmental issue—it is a geopolitical one.</p>

      <p>As sea levels rise, storms grow more destructive, and agricultural patterns shift, nations are being forced to reconsider borders, migration policy, and diplomatic priorities. Small island states such as Tuvalu and the Maldives face existential threats, with leaders seeking legal frameworks to preserve national sovereignty even if their land becomes uninhabitable.</p>

      <p>At the same time, climate-induced migration is expected to displace over 200 million people by 2050, according to the World Bank. This mass movement challenges border security, resource allocation, and national identities—especially in already fragile regions.</p>

      <p>In the Sahel, desertification is fuelling conflict over grazing land and water access. In the Arctic, melting ice caps have intensified a global race for oil and military advantage. Countries like China, Russia, and the US are recalibrating their positions—not for climate mitigation, but for control of what lies beneath the thaw.</p>

      <p>While global summits talk of cooperation, the reality on the ground reveals climate as a multiplier of inequality and division. Without structural reform, the nations who caused the least harm may suffer the most.</p>
